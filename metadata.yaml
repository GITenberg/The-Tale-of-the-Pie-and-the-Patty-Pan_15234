description: "The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan (originally, The Pie and the Patty-Pan)\
  \ is a children's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, and published\
  \ by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905. It tells of a cat called Ribby and a\
  \ tea party she holds for a dog called Duchess. Complications arise when Duchess\
  \ tries to replace Ribby's mouse pie with her own veal and ham pie, and then believes\
  \ she has swallowed a small tin pastry form called a patty-pan. Its themes are etiquette\
  \ and social relations in a small town.\nA version of the tale was composed by Potter\
  \ in 1903, but set aside to develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete\
  \ a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead.\
  \ Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale more fully\
  \ before publication. The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey,\
  \ a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and have been described\
  \ as some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat\
  \ living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs\
  \ Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the\
  \ magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.\nThe tale was published in a larger\
  \ size than Potter's previous books, but was reduced in the 1930s to bring it into\
  \ line with the other books in the Peter Rabbit series. It was given its present\
  \ title at that time. Potter declared the tale her next favourite to The Tailor\
  \ of Gloucester. Beswick Pottery released porcelain figurines of the tale's characters\
  \ through the latter half of the 20th century, and Schmid & Co. released a music\
  \ box in the 1980s.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
